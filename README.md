//frontend development

1) For developing the Appointment Booking Application, I have used react vite for frontend development.
2) For styling purpose I have used Tailwind css.
3) The developed application will be responsive to modile/Tablet/Desktops devices.
4) Here i have taken the dummy data for rendering the doctor details,I have used local storage for storing doctors and user information across the page refresh
   the data will be persist.

//Tools/Libraries I have used

1)React.js-	Building reusable UI components and managing app state
2)React Router DOM - Routing between pages (e.g., /, /doctor/1)
3)Vite - Fast development server and build tool for modern frontend
4)Tailwind CSS -	Utility-first CSS framework for responsive and styled UI
5)LocalStorage API	Store user data (selected doctor, appointment info) persistently
